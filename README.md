**ERC20 Token and Vault Contracts README**

This repository contains Ethereum smart contracts for ERC20 tokens and a secure vault for storing these tokens.

### ERC20 Token Contract

The ERC20 token contract implements the standard ERC20 interface for creating and managing tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides basic functionalities such as token transfers, approvals, and balance inquiries.

### Vault Contract

The Vault contract provides a secure storage solution for ERC20 tokens. It includes features like multi-signature authorization for withdrawals and withdrawal limits to control token access.

### Deployment

Deploy these contracts on Ethereum or compatible blockchains using standard deployment tools like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat. Customize contract parameters during deployment as needed.

### Usage

Interact with the ERC20 token contract using standard ERC20 methods like `transfer` and `approve`. Use the Vault contract for secure token storage, managing deposits and withdrawals.

### Security

Before deploying in production, conduct security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities. Implement proper access controls and emergency procedures for handling security incidents.
